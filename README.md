# End-to-End-DevSecOps-Kubernetes
Advanced End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes 3-Tier Project using AWS EKS, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jenkins
# Project Overview: AWS DevOps Pipeline with Jenkins, EKS, and ArgoCD
This project involves setting up a comprehensive DevOps pipeline on AWS, leveraging Jenkins, EKS, and ArgoCD to automate and manage infrastructure and deployment processes. Below is a detailed plan covering each key aspect of the project:

# 1. IAM User Setup
## Objective: Create an IAM user with permissions required for deploying and managing resources.
### Steps:
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
Attach necessary policies (e.g., AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonEKSFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, etc.) to the IAM user.
Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for future use.
# 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
## Objective: Use Terraform and AWS CLI to provision the Jenkins server on AWS.
### Steps:
Install Terraform and AWS CLI on your local machine.
Write a Terraform script to create an EC2 instance for Jenkins.
Define security groups, IAM roles, and key pairs within the Terraform script.
Run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to provision the infrastructure.
# 3. Jenkins Server Configuration
## Objective: Install and configure Jenkins and associated tools on the EC2 instance.
### Steps:
SSH into the EC2 instance.
Install Docker: sudo apt-get install docker.io.
Install Jenkins: Follow the Jenkins installation guide for Ubuntu.
Install Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.
Sonarqube: Use Docker to run Sonarqube.
Terraform and AWS CLI: Install via package managers or manually.
Kubectl: Follow the installation guide from Kubernetes.
Trivy: Install Trivy using instructions from the Trivy website.
# 4. EKS Cluster Deployment
## Objective: Create an Amazon EKS cluster using eksctl.
### Steps:
Install eksctl on the Jenkins server.
Use eksctl create cluster to provision the EKS cluster.
Verify cluster creation by running kubectl get nodes.
# 5. Load Balancer Configuration
## Objective: Configure an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.
### Steps:
Set up an ALB Ingress Controller in the EKS cluster.
Define an Ingress resource in your Kubernetes configuration to manage routing.
# 6. Amazon ECR Repositories
## Objective: Create private Docker repositories on Amazon ECR.
### Steps:
Navigate to the ECR service in the AWS Management Console.
Create repositories for frontend and backend Docker images.
Configure repository policies and permissions.
# 7. ArgoCD Installation
## Objective: Install and configure ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.
### Steps:
Install ArgoCD using Helm or kubectl.
Access the ArgoCD web UI and configure it with necessary permissions.
Connect ArgoCD to your Git repository for application deployment.
# 8. Sonarqube Integration
## Objective: Integrate Sonarqube for code quality analysis.
### Steps:
Configure Jenkins pipelines to include Sonarqube analysis steps.
Set up Sonarqube scanner within Jenkins jobs.
Review Sonarqube reports for code quality insights.
# 9. Jenkins Pipelines
## Objective: Create Jenkins pipelines to deploy frontend and backend code.
### Steps:
Define Jenkinsfiles for backend and frontend applications.
Set up stages for building, testing, and deploying Docker images to ECR.
Configure deployment to the EKS cluster.
# 10. Monitoring Setup
## Objective: Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
### Steps:
Install Helm on the Jenkins server.
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.
Configure monitoring dashboards in Grafana for EKS metrics.
# 11. ArgoCD Application Deployment
## Objective: Use ArgoCD to deploy a Three-Tier application.
### Steps:
Define ArgoCD application manifests for database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.
Apply these manifests via ArgoCD to manage deployments and updates.
# 12. DNS Configuration
## Objective: Configure DNS settings to make the application accessible via custom subdomains.
### Steps:
Set up Route 53 hosted zones and records for your domain.
Configure DNS settings to point to the ALB or Ingress controller.
# 13. Data Persistence
## Objective: Ensure data persistence for database pods using persistent volumes and claims.
### Steps:
Define PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) resources in Kubernetes.
Configure your database deployment to use these PVCs.
# 14. Conclusion and Monitoring
## Objective: Summarize achievements and monitor the EKS cluster’s performance.
### Steps:
Review the project setup and highlight key accomplishments.
Continuously monitor the EKS cluster’s performance using Grafana dashboards.
